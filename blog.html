        <h2>Difference between localStorage and sessionStorage</h2>
        <br>
        <p>sessionStorage is similar to localStorage; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.
        The one major difference between localStorage and sessionStorage is the expiration date.
        
        localStorage persists the storage across browser sessions. So even if the domain is opened in a new tab, or the browser is closed and reopened, the storage is saved. There is no expiration.
        sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. A page session lasts as long as the tab or the browser is open.
        Therefore, when you open a new tab or a new window, this creates a new session and new storage.</p>

        <h2>Global scope VS Block scope</h2>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Global Scope:</strong> The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope.
        Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state
        can access that variable.</p>
        <p><strong>Block Scope:</strong> Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the
        curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else. You are only
        allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.</p>

        <h2>How does work JavaScript event loop?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>
        <p>It’s interesting to note that ES6 specifies how the event loop should work, meaning that technically it’s within the scope of the JS engine’s responsibilities, which is no longer playing just a hosting environment role. One main reason for this change is the introduction of Promises in ES6 because the latter require access to a direct, fine-grained control over scheduling operations on the event loop queue.</p>

        <h2>How many ways we get undefined?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>There are 8 different ways we can have undefined</p>
        <ol class="list-undefined">
          <li>Try to access Uninitialized variable.</li>
          <li>Invoke function without return statement.</li>
          <li>Function parameter that is not passed but if you try to acces it within funcion</li>
          <li>Empty return statement display undefined.</li>
          <li>Non existing property in object.</li>
          <li>Accessing array element out of index.</li>
          <li>Deleting an element inside an array.</li>
          <li>Initialized Value by undefined in code.</li>
        </ol>
